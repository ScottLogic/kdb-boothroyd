# KDB Boothroyd

_Now pay attention..._

Boothroyd is a GUI for KDB+/q database built with React on Electron. The name, if you are wondering, is taken from the [James Bond character Q](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)>).

## Getting Started

To run this project.

- Install the dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

- To set up the precommit hooks run:

```
  npm run prepare
```

- Now run these two commands in separate consoles.

```bash
  npm run dev:react
```

```bash
  npm run dev:electron
```

## Testing

To test the project you'll need a q server running on port 5001. Then run:

```bash
  npm run build:test
  npm test
```

## What We've Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): The main app structure is built using React Functional Components
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): We're using electron to wrap everything as a desktop app
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Everything is written in Typescript for extra safety
- [FluentUI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web): We're using FluentUI and it's built React components for layout and trying to follow their design language where possible.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron): We're using Playwright to run our automated integration tests.
